# The test of Markdown language

### Hi there! :relaxed: My name is Mary, and this is a test of Markdown language capabilities.
_Since I know nothing about the IT-world I haven't written the typical readme introduction. Because, obviously, it intends that you have an experience in this area. 
Well, I haven't had it yet. I've just started my journey, so I decided to write this file in this way. Let's see what I can do with this tags._

>By the way, I find Markdown language very similar to an another markup I used when I was fourteen. 
>I was making up something kind of a context menu for a one community on the [VK.com](https://vk.com/) (the Russian online social media). 
>It contained an articles, lists, pictures and links (an inline links mostly). And I can say I was enjoying the process of creating this.
>It was plain and accessibly, just like here now. Good times...

#### What can I tell about myself? 
Those are just some basic facts about me. 

* I am Ukrainian.
* 24 years old.
* Currently live in England. I moved in here with my sister and mother in the beginning of April.
* My favourite color is red `#990d0d`.
* I'm trying to improve myself, so I've started to learn English recently. This article is an another challenge for me. :smile:
* I like challenges.
* Besides I like to learn something new.
* For these two reasons above, I decided to roll into IT and see how it'll work out.
